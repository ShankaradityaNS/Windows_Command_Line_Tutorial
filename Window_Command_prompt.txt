26) Computer associates certain file extensions with certain programs. This is how your computer knows to open 
    Adobe when you double click a PDF file, or Microsoft Word when you double click a DOC file. You can view all 
    the file associations your computer knows about by typing ASSOC in the command window. You’ll see the file 
    extension and the program it’s associated with.

	assoc

    We can set the association by typing something like-
	 assoc .doc=Word.Document.8.

27) File Compare:
     CMD command offers the ability to compare files and see all differences, The FC command performs either an 
     ascii or a binary file comparison and will list all of the differences that it finds.

	fc /a File1.txt File2.txt 
     will compare two ascii files.

	fc /b Picture1.jpg Picture2.jpg 
     will do a binary compare on two images.

28)  IP Configuration:
     Using this command in the CMD command prompt returns detailed information about your current network 
     adapter connection including:
	Current IP Address
	Subnet Mask
	Default Gateway IP
	Current domain
    This information can help you troubleshoot router issues and other connection issues you could be having 
    with your network adapter.
	ipconfig 	or
	ipconfig /all

29) Network Statistics:
    NETSTAT command in the command prompt, you can get a list of all active TCP connections from your computer.	 
	netstat

30) Send Test Packets:
    Running this command sends test packets over the network to the target system. You can use the PING command 
    to test whether your computer can access another computer, a server, or even a website. It can help with 
    revealing network disconnections. It also provides transit time for the packets in milliseconds, so it 
    also reveals a bad network connection as well.
	ping google.com

31) Trace Route:
    TRACERT is a fascinating Windows Command to use. If you’re ever curious to see the path your internet traffic 
    takes to get from your browser to a remote system like Google servers, you can use TRACERT to see it.The 
    command stands for “Trace Route”, which sends packets out to a remote destination (server or website), and 
    provides you with all of the following information:
	Number of hops (intermediate servers) before getting to the destination
	Time it takes to get to each hop
	The IP and sometimes the name of each hop
    TRACERT can reveal how the routes of your internet requests change depending where you’re accessing the web. It 
    also helps with troubleshooting a router or switch on a local network that may be problematic.  
	tracert google.com

32) Power Configuration:
    Frustrated with how quickly your laptop seems to run out of power. Windows CMD command called POWERCFG 
    (power configuration) that can help. Run the command prompt as an administrator and type-
	 powercfg – energy 
    to get a full power efficiency report.The process can take up to about a minute, but when it’s done, you’ll see 
    whether there are any warnings or errors that might help you improve the power efficiency of your system.

33) System Information:
    If you need to know what brand of network card you have, processor details, or the exact version of your Windows 
    OS, the SYSTEMINFO command can help.
	systeminfo

34) System File Checker:
    If you’re ever concerned that a virus or some other software might have corrupted your core system files, there’s 
    a Windows command that can scan those files and ensure their integrity.You need to launch CMD as administrator 
    (right click and choose Run as Administrator). Typing-
	 SFC /SCANNOW 
    will check the integrity of all protected system files. If a problem is found, the files will be repaired with 
    backed-up system files.The SFC command also lets you:

    /VERIFYONLY: Check the integrity but don’t repair the files.
    /SCANFILE: Scan the integrity of specific files and fix if corrupted.
    /VERIFYFILE: Verify the integrity of specific files but don’t repair them.
    /OFFBOOTDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline boot directory.
    /OFFWINDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline Windows directory.
    /OFFLOGFILE: Specify a path to save a log file with scan results.
    The scan can take up to 10 or 15 minutes, so give it time.

35) Check Disk:
    While the SFC command only checks the integrity of core system files, you can use the CHKDSK command to scan an 
    entire drive.The command to check the C: drive and repair any problems, launch the command window as an administrator 
    and type-
	 CHKDSK /f C:.
    This command checks for things like:
    File fragmentation
    Disk errors
    Bad sectors
    The command can fix any disk errors (if possible). When the command is finished, you’ll see a status of the scan 
    and what actions were taken.

36) Hostname Command:
    A very simple command that displays the host name of your machine. This is much quicker than going to the control 
    panel>system route.
	hostname

37) MAC Address Command:
    A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) 
   for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.Another very simple command that shows the MAC
   address of your network interfaces.
	getmac

38)  Address Resolution Protocol(arp) Command:
     The Address Resolution Protocol is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a 
     MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. This mapping is a critical 
     function in the Internet protocol suite.This is used for showing the address resolution cache. This command must 
     be used with a command line switch-
	 arp -a 


39) To Play Star Wars on CMD:
